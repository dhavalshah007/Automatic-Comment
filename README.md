## General info
So few days back, one of my Artist friend told me regarding her art work used by another LinkdIn Account saying this is their work. 
<br>And those accounts have lots of Followers and particular post has lots of (in K's) likes and comments.<br><br> So I decided to help her out by marking this post as fake so LinkedIn can take serious action against it.
<br><br>Then I thoght of actually sending each Commentor with a Proper reply, saying this is Fake post so their follower will also get to know this Profile is fake.
<br><br>Personally replying on each and every comment is a very tidious task so thought of doing some <b>Wb Scraping</b>. 
<br>Actually extracting every comment , click on the reply button, write the comment and post it.
